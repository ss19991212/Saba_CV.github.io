        <h1>Professional Experience</h1>
          <p>Driven and tenacious young professional from Georgia. With a bachelor's
            degree in International Relations. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in
            Central and East European, Russian and Eurasian studies through the
            Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree program. I have a diverse range of
            internship experiences. My professional background includes a role at US
            Embassy in Tbilisi, at Public Affairs Section, internship in the department of Planning, Research and International Relations at the National Center of
            Education Quality Enhancement of Georgia and at the Communications
            Department at the Administration of the President of Georgia. These
            experiences have provided me with valuable insights into public relations,
            communications and strategic-planning.
            Recently I have started expanding my skillset and have become interested in
            the promising field of Digital Marketing. I have obtained the certificate from
            Google's Digital Garage, Digital Marketing course, alongside Coursera's
            Specialization in SEO course. As well as Codeacademy's certificate of HTML/
            CSS to complement my SEO skills. Currently I am studying Google Analytics
            and plan to improve my data analysis and market research skills.</p>

        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
          <p>Driven and tenacious young professional from Georgia with a bachelor's
            degree in International Relations. Currently pursuing a Master's degree in
            Central and East European, Russian and Eurasian studies through the
            Erasmus Mundus Joint Master's Degree program. I have a diverse range of
            internship experiences. My professional background includes a role at the US
            Embassy in Tbilisi, at Public Affairs Section, internship in the department of Planning, Research and International Relations at the National Center of
            Education Quality Enhancement of Georgia and at the Communications
            Department at the Administration of the President of Georgia. These
            experiences have provided me with valuable insights into public relations,
            communications, strategic-planning and content creation.
            Recently I have started expanding my skillset and have become interested in
            the promising field of Digital Marketing. I have obtained the certificate from
            Google's Digital Garage, Digital Marketing course, alongside Coursera's
            Specialization in SEO course. As well as Codeacademy's certificate of HTML/
            CSS. 
            I aim to leverage these skills alongside my academic background and a talent for writing to contribute to the 
            image and visibility of an organization</p>
